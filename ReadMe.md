# SevenPHP

Built majorly with the Seven Library & Packages as a microservice restful framework with the intent to make it easily re-workable for any project (including SwoolePHP). The major focus for the development of the framework is to make most microservice development task as easy as possible while highly performant.


# WorkSpace
All code you'd both write and edit are all in the root's app folder.
Configuration settings and keys are kept in the config/app.php file and are all accessible using the app helper
```php
#For example to get your app's url, you can do the following:
app()->get('APP_URL')

```


## Creating Migrations

# This section shows you how to :- 
	*create database,
	*migrate, 
	*populate, 
	*drop 
	table(s) using the name



# Database Creation
Database can be created using the terminal, for example, to create a database called music, use:
```bash
	php Engineer app::db music
```

Migrations can be added to the App\Providers\MigrationEngine migrate method in the form:

```php

###
return [
	//table ids are automatically generated as primary keys
	'apps' => [
		//the referenced table must already exist and the name must be exact to avoid errors
		'token' => $this->foreign_key($table='sessions_table', $column='session' $type = 'int' || 'string'),
		//$key can be one of [ 'primary', 'unique','fulltext', '' ]
		'name' => $this->string($max_length=125, $null=true),
		'pos' => $this->integer($max_length=10),
		//in other to specify a maximum length, float should be used instead of a double
		'account_balance' => $this->double() || $this->float($max_length=16), 
		'is_verified' => $this->oneOf($options=["'true'", "'false'"], $default="'false'" ),
		'created_at' => $this->datetime()
	],
	//constraints: a table can only have one primary key and it will be autogenerated
	'users' => [
		'name' => $this->string($max_length=125, $null=false),
		'email' => $this->string($max_length=125, $null=false, $key='unique'),
		'password' => $this->string($max_length=125),
		'backup_pass' => $this->string($max_length=150),
		'activation' => $this->string($max_length=225),
		'verified' => $this->oneOf($options=["'true'", "'false'"], $default="'false'" ),
		'created_at' => $this->datetime(),
		'deleted' => $this->oneOf($options=["'true'", "'false'"], $default="'false'" )
	],
	
	'user_sessions' => [
		'user_id' => $this->foreign_key($table='users', $column='id', $type = 'int' ),
		'session' => $this->string($max_length=225, $null=false),
		'user_agent' => $this->string($max_length=225, $null=false),
		'push_token' => $this->string($max_length=225, $null=false),
		'created_at' => $this->datetime(),
		'deleted' => $this->oneOf($options=["'true'", "'false'"], $default="'false'" )
	],
];
//constraints: a table can only have one primary key and it will be autogenerated
### id is auto-generated and would be ignored
``` 

# Populating a table with data manually by the developer can be done by adding array of arrays to the App\Providers\MigrationEngine populate method's return array
```php
return [
	'table name' => [ 'column name' => 'value' , 'column name' => 'value' , 'column name' => 'value' ],
	'table name' => [...],
];
#always remove the arrays after migration
```

Dropping table(s) can be done by adding table names to the App\Providers\MigrationEngine drop method's return array
```php
return [ 'user', 'user_sessions' ]; //drop tables
```

# Migration Generation Steps

=> After creating migrations

=> Add Name of tables to be migrated to the MIGRATION array in the configuration app.php file in the config folder

```php
'MIGRATION' => [
	'users', 'user_session', 'contact_us'
]
#Always remember to remove already migrated models from the array
```

=>then run "php Engineer app::migrate" in the terminal
